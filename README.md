You are to build a playable game of Connect Four that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player (“player”) to play against a (simplistic) computer player (“computer”). The game will run from the command line with the following command:
```$ ruby ./lib/connect_four.rb
```
From there, players will be asked to enter column names to place one of their pieces in a column. The computer will also place its own pieces. The player and the computer will continue to take turns until either one has won the game or they have played to a draw.

Here is a representation of the start of a game.

The Game is over when either the Player or Computer connects four of their pieces as described below, or the game ends in a draw (also described below).
Here is a representation of the human player (the ‘X’ player) winning the game with four connected pieces horizontally (in the same row).
